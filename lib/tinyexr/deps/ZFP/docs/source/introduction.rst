Introduction
============

|zfp| is an open-source library for representing multidimensional numerical
arrays in compressed form to reduce storage and bandwidth requirements.
|zfp| consists of four main components:

* An **efficient number format** for representing small, fixed-size *blocks*
  of real values.  The |zfp| format usually provides higher accuracy per bit
  stored than conventional number formats like IEEE 754 floating point.

* A set of :ref:`classes <arrays>` that implement storage and manipulation
  of a **multidimensional array data type**.  |zfp| arrays support high-speed
  read and write random access to individual array elements and are a
  drop-in replacement for :code:`std::vector` and native C/C++ arrays.
  |zfp| arrays provide accessors like :ref:`proxy pointers <pointers>`,
  :ref:`iterators <iterators>`, and :ref:`views <views>`.  |zfp| arrays
  allow specifying an exact memory footprint or an error tolerance.

* A :ref:`C library <hl-api>` for **streaming compression** of partial or
  whole arrays of integers or floating-point numbers, e.g., for applications
  that read and write large data sets to and from disk.  This library
  supports fast, parallel (de)compression via OpenMP and CUDA.

* A **command-line executable** for :ref:`compressing binary files <zfpcmd>`
  of integer or floating-point arrays, e.g., as a substitute for
  general-purpose compressors like :code:`gzip`.

As a compressor, |zfp| is primarily *lossy*, meaning that the numerical
values are usually only approximately represented, though the user may
specify error tolerances to limit the amount of loss.  Fully
:ref:`lossless compression <q-lossless>`, where values are represented
exactly, is also supported.

|zfp| is primarily written in C and C++ but also includes
:ref:`Python <zfpy>` and :ref:`Fortran <zforp>` bindings.
|zfp| is being developed at
`Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory <https://www.llnl.gov>`__
and is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's
`Exascale Computing Project <https://www.exascaleproject.org>`__.

Usage
-----

The typical user will interact with |zfp| via one or more of its components,
specifically

* Via the :ref:`C API <hl-api>` when doing I/O in an application or otherwise
  performing data (de)compression online.  High-speed, parallel compression is
  supported via OpenMP and CUDA.

* Via |zfp|'s in-memory :ref:`compressed-array classes <arrays>` when
  performing computations on very large arrays that demand random access to
  array elements, e.g., in visualization, data analysis, or even in numerical
  simulation.  These classes can often substitute C/C++ arrays and STL
  vectors in applications with minimal code changes.

* Via the |zfp| :ref:`command-line tool <zfpcmd>` when compressing
  binary files offline.

* Via :ref:`third-party <app-support>` I/O libraries or tools that support |zfp|.



Technology
----------

|zfp| compresses *d*-dimensional (1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D) arrays of integer or
floating-point values by partitioning the array into cubical blocks of |4powd|
values, i.e., 4, 16, 64, or 256 values for 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D arrays,
respectively.  Each such block is independently compressed to a fixed-
or variable-length bit string, and these bit strings may be concatenated
into a single stream of bits.

|zfp| usually truncates each per-block bit string to a fixed number of bits
to meet a storage budget or to some variable length needed to meet a given
error tolerance, as dictated by the compressibility of the data.
The bit string representing any given block may be truncated at any point and
still yield a valid approximation.  The early bits are most important; later
bits progressively refine the approximation, similar to how the last few bits
in a floating-point number have less significance than the first several bits.
The trailing bits can usually be discarded (zeroed) with limited impact on
accuracy.

|zfp| was originally designed for floating-point arrays only but has been
extended to also support integer data, and could for instance be used to
compress images and quantized volumetric data.  To achieve high compression
ratios, |zfp| generally uses lossy but optionally error-bounded compression.
Bit-for-bit lossless compression is also possible through one of |zfp|'s
:ref:`compression modes <modes>`.

|zfp| works best for 2D-4D arrays that exhibit spatial correlation, such as
continuous fields from physics simulations, images, regularly sampled terrain
surfaces, etc.  Although |zfp| also provides support for 1D arrays, e.g.,
for audio signals or even unstructured floating-point streams, the
compression scheme has not been well optimized for this use case, and
compression ratio and quality may not be competitive with floating-point
compressors designed specifically for 1D streams.

In all use cases, it is important to know how to use |zfp|'s
:ref:`compression modes <modes>` as well as what the
:ref:`limitations <limitations>` of |zfp| are.  Although it is not critical
to understand the
:ref:`compression algorithm <algorithm>` itself, having some familiarity with
its major components may help understand what to expect and how |zfp|'s
parameters influence the result.
